TJ Math 4,316154,"9, 10, 11",0.5,1,N/A,"Students study right triangle relationships, identities and equations, the unit circle and graphing. Class includes modeling and application problems. Topics include finding values of trigonometric functions, finding exact trigonometric values of special angles in degrees and radians, finding exact angles of inverse trigonometric functions, trigonometric identities, transformations and finding domain, range, amplitude, period, and shifts, graphing inverse trigonometric functions, solving trigonometric equations and inequalities, solving practical problems using the law of sines and cosines, vectors applications, polar coordinate system, using De Moivre's theorem with complex numbers, and three-dimensional modeling and applications. The process standard focus will be Connections."
TJ Math 5,316055,"9, 10, 11",0.5,1,TJ Math 4,"The study of Advanced Functions includes an extension of topics first introduced in algebra. All parent function graphs and their transformations are a focus as well as the important features of graphs such as symmetry, concavity, extrema and end behavior. Operations on functions are studied, especially composition, and finding appropriate domains is stressed. Specific functions such as exponential and logarithmic are explored and used for graphing, solving equations, and applications. Other topics of study include sequences and series, proof by math induction, and the exploration of conic sections and their applications and an introduction to the fundamentals of calculus, including limits, continuity, and the concept of the derivative. The process standard focus will be Communication. Upon conclusion of TJ Math 5, students will be advised as to which level of AP Calculus they should take the following school year."
Calc BC,317704,"11, 12",1,1,Precalculus with Trigonometry Honors or AP Precalculus or AP Calculus AB.,"This course includes all topics of Advanced Placement Calculus AB with additional topics. This course emphasizes a multi-representational approach to calculus. Concepts, results, and problems are expressed graphically, numerically, analytically, and verbally. Topics include concepts and applications of differential and integral calculus, sequences and series, and elementary differential equations. Graphing utilities and other relevant technology tools will be used when appropriate to support instruction, especially to allow students to explore graphical, numerical, and symbolic relationships. Content of this college-level course corresponds to the syllabus of the College Board Calculus BC Advanced Placement Program."
